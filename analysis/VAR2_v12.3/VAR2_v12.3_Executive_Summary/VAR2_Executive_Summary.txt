====================================================================================================

1. MODEL SPECIFICATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Model: Vector Autoregression with 2 lags (VAR(2))
  Variables: 8 key bureaucratic/personnel indicators
  Time Period: 1987-2024 (37 years, 38 observations)
  Observations Used: 36 (after lagging)
  Average R-squared: 0.9708 (97% of variance explained)

  Variables Included:
    1. Warrant Officers (Warrant_Officers_Z)
    2. Policy Volume (Policy_Count_Log)
    3. Company Grade (O-1 to O-3) (Company_Grade_Officers_Z)
    4. Political Appointees (Total_PAS_Z)
    5. FOIA Delay (FOIA_Simple_Days_Z)
    6. Junior Enlisted (E-1 to E-4) (Junior_Enlisted_Z)
    7. Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) (Field_Grade_Officers_Z)
    8. Civilian Personnel (Total_Civilians_Z)

2. KEY FINDINGS: SHORT-RUN DYNAMICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. PRIMARY DRIVERS (Variables with strongest outward influence):
    1. Field Grade (O-4 to O-5): Total outward influence = 7.942
       → dampens Policy Volume (strength: 4.804)
       → dampens Civilian Personnel (strength: 0.958)
       → amplifies FOIA Delay (strength: 0.766)

    2. Warrant Officers: Total outward influence = 7.437
       → dampens Policy Volume (strength: 2.284)
       → amplifies Civilian Personnel (strength: 1.688)
       → amplifies Political Appointees (strength: 1.420)

    3. Company Grade (O-1 to O-3): Total outward influence = 6.690
       → amplifies Policy Volume (strength: 5.037)
       → dampens Junior Enlisted (E-1 to E-4) (strength: 0.451)
       → amplifies Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) (strength: 0.343)

  B. PRIMARY RECEIVERS (Variables most influenced by others):
    1. Policy Volume: Total inward influence = 15.916
       ← amplified by Company Grade (O-1 to O-3) (strength: 5.037)
       ← dampened by Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) (strength: 4.804)
       ← dampened by Warrant Officers (strength: 2.284)

    2. Political Appointees: Total inward influence = 4.119
       ← amplified by Warrant Officers (strength: 1.420)
       ← amplified by Civilian Personnel (strength: 1.048)
       ← dampened by Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) (strength: 0.680)

    3. Civilian Personnel: Total inward influence = 3.732
       ← amplified by Warrant Officers (strength: 1.688)
       ← dampened by Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) (strength: 0.958)
       ← amplified by Political Appointees (strength: 0.418)

  C. STRONGEST INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS:
    Company Grade (O-1 to O-3) → Policy Volume: 5.037 (AMPLIFYING)
    Field Grade (O-4 to O-5) → Policy Volume: 4.804 (DAMPENING)
    Warrant Officers → Policy Volume: 2.284 (DAMPENING)
    Warrant Officers → Civilian Personnel: 1.688 (AMPLIFYING)
    FOIA Delay → Policy Volume: 1.663 (DAMPENING)



 MODEL DIAGNOSTICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Average R-squared: 0.9708
  Stationarity: 2/8 variables stationary (suggests VECM may be appropriate)
  Lag order: 2 (selected by LASSO analysis and sample size constraints)
  Sample size: n=38, adequate for 8 variables with 2 lags
