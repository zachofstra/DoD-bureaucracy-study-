JOHANSEN COINTEGRATION - LAG ORDER SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Executive Summary for DoD Bureaucratic Growth Research
================================================================================

ROBUSTNESS CHECK RESULTS:
-------------------------
Lag orders tested: 1 to 5
Variables: 7 (7-variable aggregated model)
Time period: 1987-2024 (34 observations)

COINTEGRATION RANK ACROSS LAG ORDERS:
--------------------------------------
Lag 1: 2 cointegrating relationship(s)
Lag 2: 4 cointegrating relationship(s) ** CURRENT
Lag 3: FAILED cointegrating relationship(s)
Lag 4: 3 cointegrating relationship(s)
Lag 5: 0 cointegrating relationship(s)


INFORMATION CRITERIA RECOMMENDATION:
------------------------------------
BIC optimal lag: N/A (VECM fitting failed)

AIC optimal lag: N/A (VECM fitting failed)

Current specification (Lag 2):
  - 4 cointegrating relationships

NOTE: VECM information criteria unavailable due to fitting issues. Using
trace statistic comparison and theoretical considerations instead.


⚠ WARNING: LAG SENSITIVITY DETECTED
------------------------------------
The number of cointegrating relationships VARIES across lag orders:
Lag 1: 2, Lag 2: 4, Lag 4: 3, Lag 5: 0

INTERPRETATION:
Your cointegration results are SENSITIVE to lag specification. This suggests:

1. STRUCTURAL BREAKS: The 37-year period may contain regime changes (9/11,
   sequestration, COVID) that disrupt long-run equilibria at different lags.

2. NONLINEAR DYNAMICS: Linear cointegration may not fully capture the
   bureaucratic growth process. Threshold or regime-switching models may be needed.

3. SAMPLE SIZE LIMITATIONS: With ~34 effective observations after differencing,
   higher lags consume degrees of freedom and reduce test power.

RECOMMENDATION FOR THESIS:
Report results from MULTIPLE lag specifications to show sensitivity:
1. Present lag 2 as primary specification (current, theoretically justified)
2. Show lag 1 and lag 4 results as robustness checks
3. Discuss lag sensitivity in limitations section
4. Consider threshold cointegration or regime-switching models

DO NOT cherry-pick the lag that gives your preferred result. Transparency about
lag sensitivity strengthens your thesis by showing methodological rigor.

METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR THESIS
================================================================================

1. REPORT LAG SELECTION PROCESS:
   "Lag order selection was conducted using Johansen cointegration tests for
   lags 1-5. Due to the limited sample size (34 observations, 7 variables),
   we use lag 2 as our primary specification, balancing model fit against
   degrees of freedom preservation."

2. ROBUSTNESS CHECK:
   "To verify robustness, we estimated the Johansen test for lag orders 1-5.
   The cointegration rank varied across specifications, 
   suggesting
   sensitivity to lag specification."

3. DEGREES OF FREEDOM TRADE-OFF:
   "With 34 observations and 7 variables, higher lag orders
   reduce effective sample size. Lag 2 balances model fit against parsimony,
   preserving 32
   effective observations."

4. EIGENVALUE INTERPRETATION:
   "The largest eigenvalue (λ₁ = 0.987 at lag 2)
   indicates strong
   cointegration. Eigenvalues varied
   across lag orders (SD = 0.108)."

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Your cointegration findings show LAG SENSITIVITY - report multiple specifications.

Recommended primary specification: Lag 2 (current, based on trace statistics)
Current specification status: Optimal based on available evidence

This lag sensitivity analysis demonstrates methodological rigor and strengthens
the credibility of your thesis. Graduate committees value transparency about
specification choices.
